Project Description
The Business Website Project is a fully responsive, multi-page static website built to simulate a real-world DevOps deployment workflow. The goal of this project is to design, develop, version-control, and prepare a production-grade website that will later be deployed on an AWS EC2 instance using Git, Linux, and Nginx.

The website follows a modern dark UI theme and includes essential business pages such as Home, About, Services, Portfolio, and Contact. It is designed with clean layouts, reusable components, responsive typography, and optimized asset organization to reflect professional frontend and DevOps delivery standards.
